[INFO] To complete the setup, please perform the following steps:

  1. Add the Wrapper Directory to the beginning of your PATH.
     This ensures your shell finds the Wrappers first.
     Open your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.) and add this line:

     export PATH="{{.WrapperDir}}:$PATH"

  2. Ensure bash-completion is sourced in your shell profile.
     (This is default on most systems).

  3. Restart your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.
